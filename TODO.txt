Write app to determine an optimized abspiel schedule

In what existing lists is the song
Meta data
etc.

->
Use: http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6 to play the song afterwards

Algorithm Idea:
Create clustering regardings genres (high priority)
Add other aspects as well (low priority for unclusterable parts)

ToDo:
Preprocessing of genres

Afterwards:
Play with the recommendation plugin

Steps:
0) Create a file of all credentials 
1) Get all playlists of me
2) Get a list of (dublicate free) songs
4) Get track features
	4) What features are available
	5) What features are usefull
	6) How can I add new features?
5) Perform clustering
6) Gather ranking based on similarity to eachother

-> try to generate a usefull sequence and alter it accordingly

Next Steps:
Prioritize the consideration genre and genre changes in the sequence
Create new sequences based on highs, lows and similarity
Build new attributes to tracks
Classify new tracks based on new attribute (e.g. chill etc.)
Use the new class to create start and end points of the cluster rankings!

Think of project for combination of predictive and prescriptive analytics!!!
